<h4>Oklahoma, United States</h4>

<h2>In My Youth</h2>

<p>
  I grew up in a small town in western Oklahoma
  where I worked on my father's farm until I was 16,
  getting comfortable with diesel engines and high-voltage.
  I worked in my mother's furniture store, making deliveries and helping customers in the store.
</p>

<p>
  In elementary, I worked with low-code solutions, thanks to Lego.
  In high school a friend taught me HTML and pushed me to learn JavaScript,
  while I also worked on computer maintenance and upgrades.
</p>

<h2>Computer Science at Oklahoma State University</h2>

<p>
  I started working on my undergrad CS degree, where I spent my freshman year
  working with the Theta Chi fraternity to establish a chapter on campus.
  Sophemore year I studied Computer Engineering for a semester,
  where I learned to program FPGA's and the basics of digital logic.
</p>

<p>
  Junior and senior year I was a member of the Information Security and Assurance club,
  and competed with them in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, winning regionals
  and competing at nationals. Through this, I had the opportunity to learn server and application
  security, operations, and cryptography.
</p>

<h2>Paycom Payroll - NYSE:PAYC</h2>

<p>
  I worked for a year at Paycom working with PHP, MySQL, and JQuery,
  before I was promoted to team lead over the applicant tracking system.
  I worked with 5 engineers to train them and add features to our system,
  learning teamwork, patience, and dealing with a large customer base.
</p>

<h2>Master's in Management Information Systems</h2>

<p>
  I simultaneously worked on my master's through Oklahoma State University,
  to get a better understanding of the business-side of my world.
  My capstone project let me work with 2 other graduates developing a Java-based web application
  to help the college handle students and their course dependencies:

</p>

<p>
  Stepping down from management at Paycom after 3 years,
  I moved to a SCRUM team where I focused on React frontend development.
  We continued innovating the product, including creating a mobile application.
  I stayed at Paycom for 3 years in this role.
</p>

<h2>Flogistix</h2>

<p>
  I worked with Flogistix for 6 months where I developed the deployment and frontend
  for an edge industrial PC that runs on wellsites, using AWS Greengrass, Docker Compose, and React.
  I learned how to build resilient systems when networks, sensors, and hardware were not always reliable.
</p>

<h2>Mechstack</h2>

<p>
  I began doing contract work, where I started by working with Oklahoma Robotics.
  We produced CNC machines for plastic teeth aligners. I set up an instance of LinuxCNC
  on a Raspberry Pi for each unit, configured the stepper motors, and wired in physical control buttons.
</p>

<p>
  I went on to work with a scuba diving shop to develop an Android and iOS app,
  an international artist to create her online presence,
  and a device retailer looking to manage large-scale inventory.
