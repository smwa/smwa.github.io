This is the obligatory post about starting up a blog. Starting out, I wasn't ready to host it on Github.

Github is free, quick, and simple; but too public. I'm afraid that my posts will be sparse, so I don't want people to stumble upon it. Not yet, at least.

So on to my reliable DigitalOcean droplet, which is steadily hosting all my projects.

..But how do I post to this quickly? I want to do it on my phone. Maybe an SFTP app. That'd be easy to upload pictures at least.

Or we make it very complicated, and write a webserver with a simple form, title and body. Then I need to make sure that server is secure, and started up if I ever restart the server.

This is why I haven't done this yet. Hanselman has it right though, we must own our own words.
