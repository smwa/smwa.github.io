*"... and the next thing I know we had a pair of plane tickets."*

Time to post about adventures! After a couple porch beers, a friend said they had an itch to get away and they asked where I would go. I said Maine. Why? I'm not sure. I've heard it's pretty, that there's cliff diving, friendly people, and the ocean! I checked the weather for that weekend, and the next thing I know we had a pair of plane tickets.
### Day One - Oklahoma City -> Bangor
I wake up to an email about a flight delay, and that they want to reschedule us for the next day. We could also wait the extra 3 hours and get in late. This sounded much better than waking up at 4am the next day. We went ahead to the airport at the original time of 10:30am CT, found coffee and a couch, and waited. Besides the long day of travel, we had no trouble.

We landed at 10:30pm ET in Bangor, Maine, got a car and went to the slick bed n breakfast we had booked. Tricia greeted with a smile and a tour. We walked into the king-sized suite with chocolate covered strawberries, heated floors, and the fluffiest duvet. A little time on the porch looking over the town and we called it a night.

### Day Two - Bangor -> Monroe Falls -> Bar Harbor
Rested and ready for the day, we savor their coffee and pastries and enjoy how well the house has been refurbished. [The Tarratine Inn](https://www.tarratinebangor.com/tarratine-inn/)

Then off for a real meal on the river at High Tide. Nice wait staff, good food, an a nice view of the town! I felt really good about our decisions. We walked through town to get some gear and beer, and headed to Monroe Falls.

This is private property but the owners let people come swim. There's a set of waterfalls with pools in between, most big enough to swim in! We found the biggest one that had some folks there already, and jumped in! It was deep enough to jump off of nearby rocks(if you were careful where you jumped), so we jumped, sat under the falls, and enjoyed a few beers on the rocks.

We pulled into Bar Harbor and stopped at our motel, with a view across the highway to the ocean. We switched clothes and rushed to a local seafood joint, where we sat by the water and relaxed. The waitress was a lady from out of town that got a job in Bar Harbor so that she could hike and enjoy Acadia National Park. We learned tons from her about what we needed to know for the next morning; we got an extra hour of sleep and were more prepared because of her!
We crashed at 10pm and woke up at 2:30 to begin our hike up Cadillac Mountain.

### Day Three - Acadia National Park -> Bangor -> Oklahoma City
We wake up refreshed from 4 hours of sleep, and drive into the park. There are already 2 cars there, and others are getting their headlamps on. We're at the base of Cadillac Mountain, where the sun first hits the United States most of the year. It peaks at 1500 feet above sea level(and is on the ocean) so we had a climb ahead of us. Headlamps on, we start up.

It's beautiful, but a very rough climb. There's a 200 yard stretch of 45 degree stairs, puddles to dodge, and boulders to climb. It took about an hour and a half, with breaks to stop and look over the ocean as dawn approached.

You can see a sunrise from most places, but after flying halfway across the states and hiking up a mountain: this was the best sunrise I have ever seen. The trip was definitely worth all of the absurdity! We savored it, as the cold night warmed into a blissful morning. We returned to the car, and headed to brunch in town. Yogurt, omelette, and coffee returned us to ourselves again.

We napped, explored town, and went back to the park to enjoy the beach. The ocean sounds and warm sun were excellent, but I could feel the vacation was coming to a close.
