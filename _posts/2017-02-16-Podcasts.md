I want to recommend a certain episode of a podcast here, because recommending it to my friends has not been successful.

This is an episode on Software Engineering Radio, with James Whittaker as the guest. He worked at Google before, and now at Microsoft. (several of his posts are at [Medium @docjamesw](https://medium.com/@docjamesw)).

The episode is about career development, and is a solid reminder that nobody will care about improving you as much as yourself. He also talks about finding mentors and some management strategies that have worked well for him.

[Here's the episode](http://www.se-radio.net/2017/02/se-radio-episode-281-james-whittaker-on-career-strategy/)

SE-Radio has had several good episodes that I've heard, though some have been hard to get through. I highly suggest people subscribe to it. There are other podcasts that I'd love to talk about, but I'll save those for another day.
