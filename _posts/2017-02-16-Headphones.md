I eventually went for a set of headphones, but I chose a cheaper pair in case they weren't what I wanted. They're by Senso ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof-Cancelling/dp/B01G8JO5F2/)) for $40.

They do a great job of juggling devices, they hook up to my laptop and phone without any complaints. Windows isn't quite as good at bluetooth headphones as Android is sadly, maybe someday they'll fix that. Until then, the headphones will play the audio of whichever device starts first. Decent battery, great sound, but they love to talk.

Whenever they power on, off, connect or disconnect from a device, or get a low battery, it tells you with a voice. A loud voice. This is my only complaint about this set. I've had other devices that do this, and I wasn't a fan of those either. Maybe it's the volume, or maybe it's the voice.

It is odd that I hate this, because when I make an interface for a website, I hate using symbols without words. The search button, logout, or menu buttons must have text when I make them. There can be no doubt when the user looks at it, what it does.
