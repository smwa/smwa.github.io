title: My Favorite Podcasts
---
I would like to make a shout-out to the various podcasts that I've enjoyed over the years. They are almost all technology based, since that is my main passion. I have six podcasts that I'll mention, though not all of them are equally as good. I'll order them by my preference.

My setup should probably be noted first though. I use [feedly.com](https://feedly.com/) to handle what I'm subscribed to and their categories. Their web app is fine but I use an android app [GReader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noinnion.android.greader.readerpro) to hook up to feedly. It lists all of the unread podcasts, and marks them read when I'm done. I use the app specifically because it automatically downloads the audio or video from the podcasts, if I'm on wifi and charging. I then can always have my podcasts offline without any data usage.

# Security Now
[twit.tv/shows/security-now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now)
Steven Gibson is an programmer and security expert. He's made quite a few Windows-based programs, but his knowledge is really in security and cryptography. The podcasts is a couple hours every week, as he steps through various news items from the last week; both good and bad. This is on the Twit podcast network. I always look forward to this one.

# Hanselminutes

Scott Hanselman works for Microsoft. He has a very rounded understanding of the world, and is an excellent speaker. He brings on a variety of people to be interviewed, with topics ranging from 3D Printing to programming books for kids. He has an appreciation for diversity, and the impact of technology on all people.

# FLOSS Weekly
[twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly)
FLOSS(Free, Libre, Open-Source Software) Weekly is another Twit podcast, with Randal Schwartz as the host. He has several co-hosts, one of them being from Lawton, OK; which I appreciate, since our state rarely is heard in the technology world. They interview various companies that support open-source software, both for profit and non-profit.

# Still Untitled
[tested.com/still-untitled-the-adam-savage-project](http://www.tested.com/still-untitled-the-adam-savage-project/)
This is a podcast by Adam Savage, from Mythbusters. The podcasts is a good source of rounded news from a few categories. They talk about movie and book reviews, particularly in Science Fiction. Adam is a proprietor of the technology movement for the younger generations, so this is often a topic. They also speak about various builds that they do in their shops.

# Software Engineering Radio
[se-radio.net](http://www.se-radio.net/)
Software-Engineering Radio is truly for programmers. They bring on a person to be interviewed within their area of expertise. This might include distributed systems, or career development. I listen to this podcast for pure knowledge, though it can be difficult at times to stay with them as they dig into the technicalities of technologies I haven't used before.

# Tech Stuff
[shows.howstuffworks.com/techstuff-podcast.html](http://shows.howstuffworks.com/techstuff-podcast.htm)
Jonathan Strickland hosts this show going over various technologies. He focuses on specific topics, such as authentication, or how mp3 files work. He is a good speaker, but the topics don't always match my interests so I pick and choose the episodes.
