title: Getting Rid of Devices
---
I've decided to streamline my music listening experience. I have 3 pairs of headphones that I switch between.

* Studio style headphones to block out noise at work
* Bluetooth behind-the-head for working out, with bad audio quality
* Wired sports headphones for around the house

If I were to use 1 pair for everything, they'd have to be wireless and light. The Jabra Pace look pretty solid. Good quality, bluetooth, and not absurd looking.

Better yet, it remembers 8 paired devices, and can be connected to 2 at the same time. In theory, this can be my phone and laptop, or phone and work computer, and switch between them with ease.

Even if that theory is true, my work computer doesn't have bluetooth, and they don't seem to be keen on me adding it. They do have transmitters on Amazon, plugs into a 3.5mm jack and lets you connect bluetooth headphones. That'd appease IT, but it leaves another piece that could fail.

I think the easiest way to know if it'll work is just to try it.
