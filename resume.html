<h1>Michael Smith</h1>
<h4>Oklahoma, United States</h4>

<p>
  I am a software engineer from Oklahoma with a passion for practical technology. I
  began learning web development in junior high, studying networking and
  operating systems in high school. I studied computer science in college, and
  learned server management and application security. I went into the workforce to
  develop web applications for Paycom, an S&P 500 company for 8 years. I studied
  industrial machines and how to run a personal business while I did contract work
  for a year. I began work at a fast-paced oil and gas company and led an industrial
  machine project from the ground up.

  Software Developer

    2014 - 2021
    <div>Paycom</div>
    <p>
      For one year I maintained an application for employee benefits, developing
      extract-transform-load processes and consuming external API's. I learned about
      the practices of a small company, while I worked with the 20 other developers at
      the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was promoted to team lead over the job board project. I worked with a team of
      4 developers to improve the usability for millions of users. I then stepped down to
      be a full-time developer on the same team while finishing my master's degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was chosen to be the tech-lead for the first Scrum team at Paycom. We were
      able to show the company that agile development could be successful. I
      continued to work closely with my agile team to develop a mobile application for
      our users using mobile-first practices.
